# reimagined-worktime
A simple web application for starting the work and gives a notification when a break is needed (like once in 50 minutes for 10 minutes)

We try an incremental approach by which we can develop things with different features in different releases :P

## Scope of the complete project ## as of now ( Imaginations and edits invited ) (of course this is open source)

* Custom worktime and break time
* Analysis
* Notify by some method (mostly pop up or through tab-title changes)
* telling of time every often ( like 30 minutes (custom) )
* what and what not :) ....

### Realease one (mostly like push one :) )

* A webpage with a start button.
* Once started the timer should start decreasing from 50 minutes (as of now)
* After timer expires change the tab-title and play a simple beep.
